<h2>Is this real?</h2>
No. This is just a silly side-project to strengthen my webdev skills.

<h2>What technologies did you use?</h2>
<a href="https://www.11ty.dev">11ty</a>, <a href="https://slinkity.dev">Slinkity</a>, <a href="https://sass-lang.com">Sass</a>, <a href="https://tailwindcss.com">Tailwind</a> + <a href="https://daisyui.com">DaisyUI</a>, <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/elasticlunr">Elasticlunr</a> and <a href="https://www.netlify.com">Netlify</a>.

I would also to credit Duncan McDougall for his blog post <a href="https://www.belter.io/eleventy-search/">Add Search to an Eleventy website with Elasticlunr</a>, which set the foundation to the search feature, and also Tom Reinert for making <a href="https://github.com/tomreinert/minimal-11ty-tailwind-starter">Minimal 11ty Starter</a> whom made the header of this project.
