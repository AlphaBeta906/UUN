This is the National State of Ikrayi, please await for an official message from the President. (x4)<br><br>
This is the National State of Ikrayi. This is not a test, nor a hoax. We are aware of this supposed United Universal Nations, and it's unlawful invasion of Ikrayi. You, as those of the lower race, should be punished for entering our glorious land. The National State of Ikrayi and it's allies will shoot down any attempt of resistance.<br><br>
UUN leaders, if you do not pay 2.5 billion tons of gold by May 1st, 2000, we will bomb the respective headquarters: Aztrax, Werbia, The Darkest World, Ralphat and Alphat. I repeat, if you do not pay 2.5 billion tons of gold by May 1st, 2000, we will bomb the respective headquarters: Aztrax, Werbia, The Darkest World, Ralphat and Alphat.<br><br>
And to the leaders of Mawbol, eat shit.<br><br>
