            The world of Darker Werbia is actively hostile towards the UUN. Please do not try to contact or travel to Darker Werbia, especially Ikrayi, as they have been shown to engage in terrorism. If you have any new and potentially worrisome information about Darker Werbia, contact the hotline UUN-172000-001.

This is the National State of Ikrayi, please await for an official message from the President. (x4)<br><br>

This is the National State of Ikrayi. This is not a test, nor a hoax. We are aware of this supposed United Universal Nations, and its unlawful invasion of Ikrayi. You, as those of the lower race, should be punished for entering our glorious land. The National State of Ikrayi and it's allies will shoot down any attempt of resistance.<br><br>

UUN leaders, if you do not pay 2.5 billion tons of gold by May 1st, 2000, we will bomb the respective headquarters: Aztrax, Werbia, and Alphat. I repeat, if you do not pay 2.5 billion tons of gold by May 1st, 2000, we will bomb the respective headquarters: Aztrax, Werbia, and Alphat. This is our last and final warning towards your inferior races, any further actions taken will lead to your eventual death.<br><br>

And to the leaders of Mawbol, eat shit.<br><br>
