## Abstract

The **World of Error** was a world that existed between June 7th, 2001 00:22:38 UTC and June 7th, 2001 00:23:46 UTC. The World of Error was formed with multiple frequencies coming into existence and harmonizing until it broke. The World of Error had a significant effect towards a cluster of worldcodes, making them unstable and cutting all connections with any other world, which includes <a href="/docs/world/dwerbia">Darker Werbia</a>.<br><br>

Due to the World of Error's existence, C/GAR/0018 funded the World Creation Program to attempt to create a man-made world.
