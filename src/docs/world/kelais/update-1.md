The recent air condition of our site in Yibble on July 17th, 2002 is determined as hazardous, with our current safety gear being not enough to deter from potential health condition. The apparent cause of this is of a recent wildfire nearby another city called "Williams", that is exponentially growing around the nearby area.<br><br>
Due to the situation, research on Kelais will be paused until the hazard subsides for the welfare of our researchers. When the levels eventually drop, there will be new protocols, which includes new safety gear, and the use of remote methods to do our tests.
