We interrupt your regular programming to bring you a message from the United Universal Nations in coordination with the Cynetian and Mastistani governments. Please standby and await further information.<br><br>

This is a broadcast from the United Universal Nations in coordination with the Cynetian and Mastistani governments. This is not a test. Please pay attention as this will provide essential information for the coming months. Information of a possible cross-world terrorist attack against the regions of Drivore, Yibble and Samarin has been received.<br><br>

The current threat level is severe, we do not know when the attack will occur, however the threat level is substantial enough to warrant an emergency shutdown of all of the aforementioned worldports. All citizens of Mastistan and Cynetia departing Kelais from the Cynetian National World-Port, the Yibblite Central World-Port and the Samarin Desert World-Port are cancelled from March 17th, 2005 to April 1st, 2005. All flights out of those worldports will either be moved to the Wysome Cross-World World-Port or the Alaner Centeral Worldport respectively, or cancelled with reimbursement in the form of cash.<br><br>

All cross-world visitors will choose either to stay in Kelais, or to leave between March 17th, 2005 to March 20th, 2005. Cross-world visitors who choose to leave Kelais with stays that end after March 20th, 2005 will be reimbursed in the form of cash. All cross-world visitors who choose to stay in Kelais will be arranged with their hotel to have an extended stay, and also be provided with a 50% discount on essentials such as water, food, and toiletries. Those with children will immediately be denied of an extended stay in Kelais, except when they can be able to stay with family.<br><br>

All cross-world visitors arriving in the Cynetian National World-Port and the Yibblite Cental World-Port will be redirected to the Wysome Cross-World World-Port and the Alaner Centeral Worldport respectively, with a free shuttle service to and from the worldports, a discount of 25% in hotel, food, and attraction fees, and also a free promotion to a mini-suite. Arrivals to Samarin Desert Worldport will immediately be cancelled, with reimbursement in the form of cash.<br><br>

Loved ones of Cynetian and Mastistani citizens that are currently outside Kelais are highly encouraged to help them book a flight now, as all of the aforementioned worldports will shut down. All future outside-Kelais arrivals to the Cynetian National World-Port, the Yibblian Central World-Port and the Samarin Desert World-Port booked to March 17th, 2005 to April 1st, 2005 will immediately be denied.<br><br>

We hope you understand the situation right now. May God bless us all.
