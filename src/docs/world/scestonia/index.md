The **World of Scestonia** is a world in the B8 cluster, and was discovered by Alphat workers who went to find worlds after the discovery of worldports in 1978. It has two planets <a href="/docs/world/scestonia/major">Major Scestonia</a> and <a href="/docs/world/scestonia/nova">Nova Scestonia</a>. Due to distiguishing seperations between the two planets, they are considered as their own worlds.<br><br>

The world is generally considered as an open world, however Nova Scestonia does not allow cross-world visitors to enter.
