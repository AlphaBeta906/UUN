**Nova Scestonia** also known as **Scestonia γ**, and formerly **Minor Scestonia** is a planet in the <a href="/docs/world/scestonia">World of Scestonia</a>. It is isolationist and took until 1999 to be discovered. It is theorized to be a split from Major Scestonia. The atmosphere contains 0.0004% chlorine, which was believed to be harmful to the atmosphere. Despite all the chlorine being removed from the atmosphere, Nova Scestonians didn’t want to be noted as a public world due to political motives, especially their isolationism from Major Scestonia. There is still ongoing tensions to this day.
