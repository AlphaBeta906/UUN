The **World Progression Classification** (**WPC**), issued by C/GAR/0013, is a classification tool used to designate integration with the UUN.

## Classes
- **<span class="text-red-500">Stage 1 - Discovery</span>** - This is newly discovered world. No visits to that world are allowed. Only people who have Level 3 security clearances are allowed to access data of that world.
- **<span class="text-orange-500">Stage 2 - In Research</span>** - This is a world that is tested by scientists and researchers to check the atmosphere, earth, and other properties that may be potentially harmful. This stage also gains information on potential-life, political intentions, biosphere, etc. Those with Level 2 and higher security clearances are also allowed to access documents pertaining to that world.
- **<span class="text-amber-500">Stage 3 - Political Discussions</span>** - This is a world where where UUN diplomats try to communicate with the international community of that world to start "world-awakening," and discuss about cross-world affairs, which includes worldport availability, peace treaties, and potentially joining the UUN. Non-UUN visits in this stage are not allowed until further notice.
- **<span class="text-green-600">Closed World</span>** - This is a world that are unregistered in the Worldport Connection Program. Some worlds do not want to be registered in the WCP, and we respect that. However worlds that allow worldports can still be entered via protective gear and a permit issued by the Department of Cross-World Affairs.
- **<span class="text-green-500">Open World</span>** - This is a world that can be visited via commercially-available worldports.
