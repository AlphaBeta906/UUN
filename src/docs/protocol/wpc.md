The **World Progression Classification** also known as **WPC**, issued by C/GAR 0013, is a classification tool used to designate integration with the UUN.

# Classes
- **<span style="color:red;">Stage 1 - Discovery</span>** - This is newly discovered world. No visits to that world are allowed.
- **<span style="color:orange;">Stage 2 - In Research</span>** - This is a world that is tested by scientists and researchers to check the atmosphere, earth, and other properties that may be potentially harmful. This stage also gains information on potential-life, political intentions, biosphere, etc. Non-research-related visits can not be allowed by the UUN.
- **<span style="color:#ffbf00;">Stage 3 - Political Discussions</span>** - This is a world where where UUN diplomats try to communicate with the international community of that world to start "world-awakening," and discuss about cross-world affairs, which includes worldport availability, peace treaties, and potentially joining the UUN. Non-UUN visits in this stage are not allowed until further notice.
- **<span style="color:green;">Closed World</span>** - This is a world that are unregistered in the Worldport Connection Program. Some worlds do not want to be registered in the WCP, and we respect that. However worlds that allow worldports can still be entered via protective gear and a permit issued by the Department of Cross-World Affairs.
- **<span style="color:#0c0;">Open World</span>** - This is a world that can be visited via commercially-available worldports.
