The **Cross-World Security Measures** (**CSM**), are 2 treaties which are the Soves Convention, and the Antronia Convention, as well as the Neuverian Special Agreements, that establish security protocols regarding cross-world travel.

## Contents

### Thricia Convention
The Thricia Convention, adopted on 1981 and revised on 1999, was a response to the growing panic regarding cross-world safety after the Thricia National Cross-World Worldport accident, killing 27 people. The Thricia Convention sets a standard for future models of worldports so as to not kill passengers, in addition to safety guidelines for worldport staff and mechanics to not accidentally harm passengers, bystanders and other crew.

### Antronia Convention
The Antronia Convention, adopted on 1987 and revised on 2002, was a response to the Antronian Cross-World Worldport Terminal 4 bombing, where an Alphadonian armed with yet to be known technology stolen from Alpha Inc, bombed the Terminal Killing, 567 people and injuring 4,508 others.<br><br>

The Antronia Convention makes all passengers and crew have major security checks during check-in, boarding and landing to find hidden and potentially technology. If a passenger or crew refuses to allow these security checks, they will be held into custody and be fined if they posses no dangerous technology. The Antronia Convention also requires that all passengers and staff have a silva test to check for potential super bugs.

### Neuverian Special Agreements
The Neuverian Special Agreements were a set of protocols, suggested by Neuver on 1999, to allow cross-world travels, as an extention to the Antronia Convention. The Neuverian Special Agreements are exclusive to Neuver only. All crew and passengers must be watched over by the Neuverian Royal Guard, be escorted at all times by the Neuverian Royal Guard, be kept away from major social events, and be housed in segregated hotels to prevent "major vulnerabilities" from destroying Neuver. The Nueverian Special Agreements prohibit immigrations to Neuver by non-Werbian citizens.
