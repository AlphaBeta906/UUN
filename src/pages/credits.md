I would credit Duncan McDougall for his blog post <a href="https://www.belter.io/eleventy-search/">Add Search to an Eleventy website with Elasticlunr</a>, which set the foundation to the search feature, Tom Reinert for making <a href="https://github.com/tomreinert/minimal-11ty-tailwind-starter">Minimal 11ty Starter</a> whom inspired me to make this website.<br><br>

And most importantly to Freecoder, Hiuyju and Bstew for helping me make the lore of this website.
