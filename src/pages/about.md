## Is this real?
Unless you're crazy, no. This is just a silly side-project to strengthen my webdev skills.

## How did you make it?
<a href="https://www.11ty.dev" class="text-[#222] dark:text-white">11ty</a>, <a href="https://slinkity.dev" class="text-[#ff00d4]">Slinkity</a>, <a href="https://sass-lang.com" class="text-[#c6538c]">Sass</a>, <a href="https://tailwindcss.com" class="text-sky-500">Tailwind</a> + <a href="https://daisyui.com" class="text-primary">DaisyUI</a>, <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/elasticlunr" class="text-[#708284]">Elasticlunr</a> and <a href="https://www.netlify.com" class="text-[#00C7B7]">Netlify</a>.<br><br>

I would also credit Duncan McDougall for his blog post <a href="https://www.belter.io/eleventy-search/">Add Search to an Eleventy website with Elasticlunr</a>, which set the foundation to the search feature, Tom Reinert for making <a href="https://github.com/tomreinert/minimal-11ty-tailwind-starter">Minimal 11ty Starter</a> whom made the overall structure of this project, and Zoltan Toth for answering <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10405945/html-ordered-list-1-1-1-2-nested-counters-and-scope-not-working">this StackOverflow post</a> and making the ordered list style present in table of contents with a slightly edited version of <a href="https://www.tipsandtricks-hq.com/simple-table-of-contents-toc-using-pure-html-and-css-code-9217">Simple Table of Contents (ToC) Using Pure HTML and CSS Code</a>.<br><br>

And most importantly to Freecoder, Hiuyju and Bstew for helping me make the lore of this website.
